        <h1>Wheatley Center
        </h1>
        <p>Completed in 2012, the Wheatley Center is the home for the School of Communications and Information Systems.
            This custom-designed facility provides Media Arts with all-new classrooms, studios, labs, and workshops
            needed to deliver the curriculum for the design and photography concentrations (TV/Video facilities still
            housed in the Academic Media Center in Patrick Henry).
            The Wheatley Center is truly a destination that students can call their own. In addition to the curricular
            spaces, the facility features the 24/7 homework lab for Media Arts students, cafe, student lounge, and the
            Media Arts Gallery. Whether you need to do work, grab a bite to eat, or get inspired, Wheatley can
            accommodate.
